You can check this page : https://www.mickael-outhier.fr/works/prod/modatetime-field/index.php for some exemples.

# Validation
I did'nt invest time for the data validation the data because we can never trust the data sent by the client. Data validation must be done by a server side script.
You can check "server-side-validation.php" for a exemple of server side validation written in PHP.

# Tested on
IE 11, Chrome 66, Opera 52, Firefox 59
